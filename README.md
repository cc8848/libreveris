Sheet music optical mark recognition, a fork of the Audiveris 
Open Music Scanner project located at 
https://kenai.com/projects/audiveris/

As of November 20, 2014, Hervé Bitteur, the prime mover behind Audiveris,
has decided to go closed source and in collaboration with a couple 
of others to create a web service which most likely will have 
a graduated fee scale.  His going open source has been a failure insofar
as basically nobody else is collaborating with him.

No major commits have appeared in Audiveris at Project Kenai 
for some time and for all intents and purposes Audiveris appears
to be frozen.  This fork will allow other to collaborate. And the more 
popular format of the Github interface hopefully will allow issues
to arise and identify bugs or enhancements.  

One major hope I have is to make use of a wiki to expand the documentation.  
This project is a very complex one and M. Bitteur's use of mathematical terms
and concepts, which are second nature to him, can be daunting to the less informed. I'm
working on a glossary which I will convert into a wiki format. Hopefully 
this project will provide a better insight into the way the code attacks 
the formidable task of making sense of a matrix of black & white pixels, 
and transform that into a structure of Music XML.  Better insight
will allow others to understand how this project works.  With understanding
might come participation.  The approach M. Bitteur has taken is brilliant, he has
spent over a decade developing this code, basically by himself.  

There has to be a way to help others easily get up to speed so they 
may make a meaningful contribution to refine the code's ability to recognize
music.
