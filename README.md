Sheet music optical mark recognition, a fork of the Audiveris 
Open Music Scanner project located at 
https://kenai.com/projects/audiveris/

As of November 20, 2014, Hervé Bitteur, the prime mover behind Audiveris,
has decided to go close source for now and in collaboration with a couple 
of others to create a web service which most likely will have 
a gradauated fee scale.

No major commits have appeared in Audiveris at Project Kenai 
for some time and for all intents and purposes Audiveris appears
to be frozen.  This fork will allow other to collaborate and the more 
popular format of the Github interface to see issues.  

One major hope I have is to make use of a wiki to expand the documentation.  This project
is a very complex one and the M. Bitteur's use of mathematical terms, which are second nature to
him, can be daunting to the less informed.  Hopefully with a better insight into the way
the code produces its results will allow others to understand how it works and thus contribute
to the code base.  The approach M. Bitteur has taken is brilliant, he has
spent over a decade developing this code.  There has to be a way
to help others get up to speed so they may make a meanginful contribution.
