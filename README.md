==========

sheet music optical mark recognition, a fork of the Audiveris Open Music Scanner project
located at https://kenai.com/projects/audiveris/

As of November 20, 2014, the Prime Mover behind Audiveris has decided to go close source for now
and in collaboration with a couple of others create a web service which most likely will will
have a gradauated fee scale.

No further commits have appeared in the current project and for all intents and purposes looks
to be frozen.  This fork will allow other to collaborate and the more popular format of
the Github interface to see issues.  

One major hope I have is to make use of a wiki to expand the documentation.  This project
is a very complex one and the Prime Mover's use of mathematical terms, which are second nature to
him, can be daunting to the less informed.  Hopefully with a better insight into the way
the code produces its results will allow others to understand how it works and thus contribute
to the code base.
